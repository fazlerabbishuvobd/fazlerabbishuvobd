I am hard working and self-motivated person. I can do fun with my nearest people and always stay happy. 

I am a student of the Department of CSE at the Green University of Bangladesh. This Year ( 2022 ) my BSC in CSE degree will be completed. 

So, It's time to do work for my family with my skill. In my all university course, I love mobile application development course.

In my childhood, my dream was to make mobile applications that's why I decided to build my career as a Mobile Application Developer from my own interest.
